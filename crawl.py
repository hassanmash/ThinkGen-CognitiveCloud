Here's why:\n\n1. **Performance**: This mouse is lightweight, smooth, and silent. The Bluetooth connection is rapid, and I've experienced no lag. It's perfect for both work and leisure.\n\n2. **Battery Life**: The built-in rechargeable battery lasts impressively long. After an initial full charge, it lasted around 10 days with 8-9 hours of daily use. No more frequent battery changes!\n\n3. **Dual Device Connectivity**: The Atom Dual Mouse can seamlessly connect to two devices simultaneously. I paired it with my iPad and laptop via Bluetooth, and switching between them is a breeze.\n\n4. **Sleek Design**: The superior finish and appearance make it stand out. Plus, the Type-C charging port adds convenience.\n\nOverall, the Offbeat Atom Dual Bluetooth Mouse combines functionality, style, and value. Highly recommended! ¬π",

First impressions:-\nPros:\n-The clicks are really muffled and silent. Good design job.\n-It‚Äôs very light in weight.\n-Good fit and finish. Mat rubber finish on the top helps with good grip.\n-The scroll wheel has nurled finish for better grip.\n-Pretty easy to use. Just click on the mode switch to switch between usb and Bluetooth.\n-Charging was quick and got fully charged in less than 2 hours, out of the box that is. Charging post use, I‚Äôll update later.\n-Works best without a mouse pad/mat (this will be a Con if you have a desk mat) the pointer movement becomes slow and glitchy on a mouse pad.\n-Auto off/sleep feature is pretty nice. It wakes up on a click.\n-Paired easily and quickly without any glitch‚Äôs to my MacBook.\nCons:\n-Although the form factor is the same as the Magic Mouse, it‚Äôs not ergonomic and doesn‚Äôt snuggly fit into your palms just like the Magic Mouse.\n-Works best without a mousepad. One star\nLess for this. I sometimes have to use it outside the desk mat due to this issue.\n- The ‚Äúmode switch‚Äù should have been provided at the bottom instead of top as it is now. You end up clicking the mouse unintentionally when you try to switch between the modes due to this.\n- Felt the length to be slightly longer than my palm. That could again be an ergonomic issue.\n-Can‚Äôt comment on battery life yet.\n-Yet to try multiple Bluetooth device connections.",
